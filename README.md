# How to use
The code snapshots are organized in multiple branches where every branch represents a challenge.

For example, the branch `01-product-preview-card-component-main` holds all code snapshots for the first challenge I solved ("Product Preview Card Component Main").

You can switch branches via the branch dropdown above the directory explorer.

Click on the branch dropdown and then select the appropriate branch for the challenge you're looking for.
